# NRD v2: single-frame neural denoiser over the composed lighting

**Status:** design (2026-10-05). Owner decisions: replace the whole denoiser stack (FidelityFX and the
per-signal plumbing); **strictly single-frame** (no denoiser history, so no smear or ghosting in
motion); denoise the **composed lighting**; a **convolutional** network; **trained in-engine** like
NeuraFI, not in Python. Supersedes NEURAA_NRD.md section 4 (NRD v1) once phase 1 lands.

## Why

The speckle owners see is in the final image, which combines terms filtered separately (GI and
reflections through FidelityFX, sun shadows, local-light shadows and sky occlusion through their own
filters) and terms filtered by nothing (the path at reflection hits, emissive under ReSTIR PT).
FidelityFX is a short clamped temporal accumulator: it removes energy (night darkening, road
reflections at 25-35% of their light), its history resets in motion so noise returns, and its history
is what smears. One denoiser after shading, single-frame, sees every noisy term once.

## Pipeline

```
Stage B (ray-driven compose), per pixel at render resolution:
  noisy diffuse lighting  / diffuse albedo   = D   (demodulated, rgb)
  noisy specular lighting / specular albedo  = S   (demodulated, rgb; FssEss as raster uses it)
  clean terms: emissive, unlit, sky, translucency  -> added after, never denoised
  guides: view Z, normal, roughness, diffuse albedo, specular hit distance (one frame, no history)
        |
NRD2 pyramid (current frame only): D and S, edge-aware 1/2, 1/4, 1/8 levels  [fixed maths]
        |
NRD2 network (conv, in-engine): tile statistics + guides at 1/4..1/8  ->  per 8x8 tile, per signal:
  level logits (4), depth / normal / luminance edge sensitivities (3)              [network]
        |
NRD2 resolve: per pixel, fixed edge-stopping weights from the tile's parameters over the candidates
  (own pixel, upsampled levels); D' and S' re-modulated, clean terms added          [fixed maths]
        |
AverSR / NeuRAA / tonemap / NeuraFI as today
```

Without weights (or with the network off) the resolve runs fixed default parameters: phase 1 ships that
on its own. FidelityFX and Voxi's per-signal reflection/shadow histories stay as the fallback behind the
Denoiser setting until NRD2 is measured better on both scenes; then they are removed.

## The network

- **Shape.** A small encoder over 1/2-resolution inputs (3x3 convolutions, ReLU, stride-2 down to 1/8),
  then 1x1 heads to the per-tile outputs. Roughly 4 layers of 16-32 channels; target inference
  0.3-0.5 ms at 1766x994 on the RX 7800 XT.
- **Inputs.** Per pixel: log-luminance of D and S at this frame, guides (view Z relative to the tile,
  normal, roughness, albedo luminance, hit distance / view Z). No history of any kind, no frame time.
- **Outputs.** Per 8x8 tile only: level logits and edge sensitivities for D and for S. Never a per-pixel
  weight map, never an image (rule 6 of NEURAA_NRD.md section 7, Pixar/Disney US 10,672,109).

## Training, in-engine

1. **Capture session** (editor: Tools > Train Neural Denoiser; or `--nrd2-train`): the camera travels a
   path and holds at poses. At each hold the renderer keeps rendering the same estimator and averages
   it on the GPU (256+ frames): that mean is the target, the single frames are the inputs. Same
   estimator, so the target is exactly what a perfect denoiser of that estimator would return.
2. **Oracle fit** (GPU): per tile, gradient descent on the resolve's parameters against the mean, over
   several noisy frames of the pose. This fits parameters, not a model.
3. **Regression** (GPU, `Aver.Render.Neural`): the network learns to predict the oracle parameters from
   the inputs. **Parameter-space loss only**: the network's own output is never run through the filter
   and scored, in training, validation, checkpointing or the live gate (rule 4, UC US 10,192,146).
4. **Weights** save as `nrd2_v1.avnn` in the user data folder (the user's copy wins over the shipped one
   in `bin/data`, as NeuraFI's). A held-out set of poses judges parameter error before weights ship.

## Engine work

| Part | Where | New |
|---|---|---|
| Demodulated D/S + guides out of Stage B; clean terms split off | `voxi.hlsl` Stage B, `VoxiRenderer` | targets, Stage B outputs |
| Pyramid + resolve (fixed maths), compose back | `modules/render.denoise` (NRD2 passes) | yes |
| Conv2D forward, backward, Adam; CPU reference; tests | `modules/render.neural` | Conv layers (today: MLP only) |
| Still-hold mean, oracle fit | `modules/render.denoise` | capture + fit passes |
| Training session, progress UI, weights IO | sandbox Tools menu, `Aver.Render.Neural` | yes |

## Phases

1. **Composed-lighting split + NRD2 resolve with fixed parameters**, behind the Denoiser setting as a
   third option (Off / FidelityFX / NRD2). Measured against FidelityFX on NeonDistrict Night and Sponza:
   speckle and energy moving and still, cost.
2. **Conv layers in `Aver.Render.Neural`**: forward + backward + Adam on the GPU, CPU reference, unit
   tests matching the two to tolerance.
3. **In-engine capture and oracle fit.**
4. **Training session, network inference in the resolve, shipped weights.**
5. **Patent sweep** for the convolutional parts (encoder over guides, per-tile outputs) before shipping.

## How it is judged

On NeonDistrict Night and Sponza (day and night): speckle (per-mille isolated pixels and band-pass
blotch energy) moving and still, energy against the reference path tracer (no darkening), smear (none
by construction; checked on a fast pan), and GPU cost against FidelityFX + the reflection path it
replaces.
